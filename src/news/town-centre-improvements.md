Newark & Sherwood District Council has announced a programme of improvement works for the town centre, including new paving on Middle Gate and enhanced seating areas around the Market Place.

Works are expected to begin in spring and will be carried out in phases to minimise disruption to businesses and shoppers. The council is encouraging residents to share their views on the proposals at an upcoming consultation event.
