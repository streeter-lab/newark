          <h2>A Journey Through Time</h2>
          <p>Newark's story stretches back to Roman times, through medieval grandeur, civil war and beyond.</p>

            <span class="timeline-item__date">Roman Era</span>
            <h3>Ad Pontem</h3>
            <p>The Romans established a settlement called Ad Pontem ("at the bridge") near modern Newark, recognising the strategic importance of the River Trent crossing. The Fosse Way, one of the great Roman roads connecting Exeter to Lincoln, passed directly through the area.</p>

            <h3>The Birth of Newark</h3>
            <p>The name "Newark" likely derives from "New Work," referring to a new fortification built during the Anglo-Saxon era. The settlement grew as a market town and a key crossing point on the River Trent, establishing the foundations of its commercial importance.</p>

            <h3>The Castle Rises</h3>
            <p>Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, founded Newark Castle as an episcopal fortress. Initially an earth-and-timber motte-and-bailey structure, it was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the 12th century in red sandstone, with a magnificent gatehouse that remains one of the finest examples of Romanesque architecture in England.</p>

            <span class="timeline-item__date">1216</span>
            <h3>Death of King John</h3>
            <p>King John, weakened by dysentery and reportedly devastated after losing the crown jewels in the Wash, arrived at Newark Castle in October 1216. He died here on the night of 18th October, making Newark forever associated with one of England's most infamous monarchs. The castle's role as a royal residence cemented its national importance.</p>

            <h3>Market Charter</h3>
            <p>Newark received its market charter, formalising centuries of trading activity in the great Market Square. The market tradition continues to this day, with the square remaining one of the finest and largest in England.</p>

            <h3>English Civil War</h3>
            <p>Newark was a Royalist stronghold and its strategic position controlling the crossing of the Trent and the Great North Road made it a prize worth fighting for. The town endured three sieges between 1643 and 1646, finally surrendering only on the direct orders of King Charles I. The Queen's Sconce, an impressive star-shaped earthwork fortification built during the war, survives as a remarkable monument in the south of the town.</p>

            <h3>Georgian Growth</h3>
            <p>Newark flourished as a coaching town on the Great North Road between London and Edinburgh. The elegant Town Hall was built in 1776, and the arrival of the railway in 1846 brought further prosperity. The town's brewing industry thrived, and fine Georgian and Victorian buildings sprang up around the Market Square.</p>

            <h3>Modern Newark</h3>
            <p>Newark is a vibrant market town of around 42,000 people in the Newark and Sherwood district. Served by two railway stations — including Newark North Gate on the East Coast Main Line — the town enjoys excellent connections while retaining its distinctive character. The opening of the National Civil War Centre in 2015 and ongoing heritage investment reflect a town that's proud of its past and confident about its future.</p>

            <h2>The Church of St Mary Magdalene</h2>
            <p>Dominating the skyline with its magnificent 252-foot (77m) spire, the Church of St Mary Magdalene is built on the scale of a cathedral. Dating from the 12th century, this Grade I listed church is one of the grandest parish churches in England.</p>
            <p>Among its treasures is a large Flemish brass commemorating Alan Fleming, a wealthy wool merchant who died in 1375. Measuring over 9 feet tall, it is one of the largest of its kind in the country. The church is a testament to the wealth that Newark's medieval wool and cloth trade brought to the town.</p>
