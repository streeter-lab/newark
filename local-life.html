            <h2>A Community That Cares</h2>
            <p>Newark is the kind of place where people look out for each other. With a population of around 42,000, it's large enough to have everything you need but small enough that you'll recognise faces at the market. Newcomers often remark on how quickly they feel part of the community.</p>
            <p>The town benefits from excellent transport links — London is less than an hour and a half away by train, yet property prices remain considerably more affordable than the south-east. It's an increasingly popular choice for families, professionals who commute, and those seeking a better quality of life without sacrificing connectivity.</p>
